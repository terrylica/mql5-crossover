## 🗂️ File Organization Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Each topic has one authoritative document
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Link to deeper documentation, don't duplicate
3. **Clear Naming** - Descriptive filenames with context
4. **Status Indicators** - Mark documents as active, deprecated, or archived

## 📍 Navigation

- **Project Root**: [`../README.md`](../README.md) - Workspace overview
- **Project Memory**: [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) - Complete context for AI agents

**Note**: When creating new documentation, place it in the appropriate subdirectory:
- Workflows and how-tos → `guides/`
